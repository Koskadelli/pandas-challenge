# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, we are analyzing data about a collection of City Schools, and drawing conclusions about their math and reading pass rates based on type of school, funding, and size. 

Resources utilized for this challenge: 
1) Began with the starter file, PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb
2) ChatGPT for assistance on using a Regular Expression to reformat a cell (namely, to remove "$" so that I could then convert the value to a float).
